🌊 Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting and Social Media Analytics

This project, developed for INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services), Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), is an integrated mobile + web platform designed to enhance disaster management and maritime safety.

The system enables citizens, coastal residents, volunteers, and disaster managers to report real-time ocean hazard observations (e.g., unusual tides, flooding, tsunami alerts, swell surges, high waves). It also leverages social media analytics and NLP to detect hazard-related discussions, identify trends, and provide actionable insights for authorities.
